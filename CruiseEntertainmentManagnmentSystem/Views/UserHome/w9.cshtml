                        payments made to you in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, real estate transactions,

                            Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee.

                            withholding tax on foreign partners’ share of effectively connected income, and

                        For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>  An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien,</li>
                            <li>A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States,</li>
                            <li> An estate (other than a foreign estate), or</li>
                            <li> A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).</li>

                        <b>Special rules for partnerships.</b> Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally
                        required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from such business.
                        Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner
                        is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting
                        a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.

                    <p>
                        In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding
                        withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States:

                        </b> Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax
                        treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties
                        contain a provision known as a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified in the saving
                        clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even
                        after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.

                        If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax
                        treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement
                        to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The treaty country. Generally, this must be
                            the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.
                        </li>
                        <li>The treaty article addressing the income. </li>

                        <b><i> Example.</i></b> Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income

                        this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years.
                        However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article
                        20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States.

                        <b>What is backup withholding?</b>
                        Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS a
                        percentage of such payments. This is called “backup withholding.”  Payments that may be subject to
                        backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions,
                        rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions,
                        and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN,
                        make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        Payments you receive will be subject to backup  withholding if:
                        <li> You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,</li>
                        <li>You do not certify your TIN when required (see the Part II instructions on page 3 for details),</li>
                        <li>The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN, </li>
                        <li>The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or</li>
                        <li> You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only). </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding.

                        <b> What is FATCA reporting? </b> The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign financial

                        In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account,
                        for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.

                        if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. person,
                        the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on the “Name” line. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity,

                        To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card,
                        from your local Social Security Administration office or get this form online
                        at www.ssa.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7,
                        Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN,
                        or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN.
                        You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/businesses
                        and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business.
                        You can get Forms W-7 and SS-4 from the IRS by visiting IRS.gov or by calling 1-800TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).

                        If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write “Applied For” in the space
                        for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments,
                        and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days
                        to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments.
                        The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to
                        backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.
                    </p>
                    <p> <b>Note.</b> Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon.</p>

                        . The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise
                        in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.

                        The IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does not request personal
                        detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or
                        similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.

                        If you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this message to phishing@irs.gov.
                        You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General
                        for Tax Administration at 1-800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal
                        Trade Commission at: <i>spam@uce.gov</i> or contact them at <i>www.ftc.gov/idtheft or 1-877IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338).</i>

                    Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide
                    your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file
                    information returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other
                    income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of
                    secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA,
                    Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the
                    form to file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information.
                    Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice
                    for civil and criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia,
                    and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws.
                    The information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to
                    federal and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal
                    law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your
                    TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payers
                    must generally withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other
                    payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties
                    may also apply for providing false or fraudulent information.
